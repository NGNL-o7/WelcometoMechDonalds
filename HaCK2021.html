                <div class="NameText">
                    I came into this project with the skills provided during basic training and HaCK training.
                    <br> Prior to those training I had minimal experince in arduino and circuitry with little to
                    <br> no experience with Solidworks, Physically assembling parts, or website development. During 
                    <br> the HaCK I was able to develop my understanding in assembling parts with screws, mounts, 
                    <br> and faseners. I was also able to improve my circuitry after burning a frew wires and improve
                    <br> my arduino coding as well as getting a better understanding of bluetooth communication.
                    <br> During the time I workded on the website I was able to explore new formating techniques
                    <br> to improve the style of the website. HaCK overall was a bit of a struggle as I tried to
                    <br> figure out why the servo.attach affect the arduino pins, why I burned wire, why my bluetooth
                    <br> got extremely hot during use, and how to design a proper mount for the servo. Reguardless
                    <br> HaCK was alot of fun and a great learning experience.

                    My name is Andrew Kunkler and I am excited to be studying Mechanical Engineering at UCLA. 
                    <br> I feel that my greatest skills lie in training, leadership and creative problem solving, and 
                    <br> I hope to leverage these technical skills in project management and systems engineering. 
                    <br> This HAcK competition proved to be a challenge, but I feel so much stronger in areas of Arduino,
                    <br> coding and CAD, and appreciate the opportunity of trial by fire. While I found the process of piecing 
                    <br> together the car components to be the greatest challenge of all, I also found this to be the most 
                    <br> fun and exciting. I am confident that I have learned a lot, and I look forward to leveraging this wide 
                    <br> range of new skills at UCLA and beyond.

                    I am Lein Pasache, a Mechanical Engineer that will be attending UCLA in the fall.
                    <br> My greatest skill is in practical training and time management. I plan to use these skills in my career
                    <br> as an engineering for one of the major space companies like NASA or SpaceX. This HAcK competition was 
                    <br> a true challenge for me, but I rose to even surprise myself. The training I had to prepare for the HAcK 
                    <br> really made me strive to be great and made me stronger on the areas of Arduino and CAD. It really showed me 
                    <br> how hard I could work in a short period of time. I love working with my hands and the experience I got in 
                    <br> assembling the RC car. I look forward to using these skills to practice in my studies and further understanding
                    <br> more complexes skills in the future.
